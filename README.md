Visual Code App Icons
======================================

A fun little project for custom Microsoft® Visual Code Icons. All rights reserved to their respective owners of the themes I am using whether it is Marvel, DC or simple editor themes.

## How to Install

**Mac OS:** Copy the `.icns` file you'd like to use. Find VS Code in your Applications folder, right click the icon and select `Get Info`. Click the icon in the top right corner so that a blue highlight appears around it. `⌘ + V` to past the new icon in. It may take a few restarts of VS Code for the icon to take.

If for some reason that doesn't work, then dragging the `.icns` to the icon (in the top left) of the info pane, until you see the green plus sign and then dropping it works.

### [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) by [@zenorocha](https://github.com/zenorocha)

Dracula is my favourite theme. I use it in all editors and terminals. Even Slack :)

I didn't have just one option for it, since the theme has many interesting colors. So, I made six different ones.
